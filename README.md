# MERN boilerplate - Fullstack Javascript

- Installation and setup

1. Clone the repo to your local machine and navigate into the directory. 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the project dependecies.
3. To run the server locally you'll need to have MongoDB shell installed or you can use mongoDB Atlas. By going to the `.env file` you can change the URI to point to a local instance of mongoDB connection or Atlas URI.
4. Run `npm start` to start the server.
5. To start the client side, navigate into the `client folder` and run `npm install` to install React dependencies. After all packages have been installed run `npm start` to run the React dev server on port:3000.


- Notes:

This is not a production-grade boilerplate but it just merely helps to get projects started quicker. There is a lot of security concerns that have not been implemented yet. Please keep that in mind when using the project.
