# Node REST API Boilerplate

## Basic Express boilerplate to create REST APIs

- Installation and setup
1. Clone the repo to your local machine and navigate into the directory. 
2. Run `npm install` to install all the project dependecies.
3. To run the server locally you'll need to have MongoDB shell installed or you can use mongoDB Atlas. By going to the .env file you can change the URI to point to a local instance of mongoDB connection or Atlas URI.
4. Run npm start to start the server.
- Notes:

This is not a production-grade boilerplate but just helps to get projects started quicker. There is a lot of security concerns that have not been implemented yet. Please keep that in mind when using the project.
